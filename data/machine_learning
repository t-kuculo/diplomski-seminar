machine learning
from wikipedia the free encyclopedia

machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data  such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data driven predictions or decisions through building a model from sample inputs machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible example applications include spam filtering detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach optical character recognition ocr search engines and computer vision

machine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics which also focuses in predictionmaking through the use of computers it has strong ties to mathematical optimization which delivers methods theory and application domains to the field machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learningvii machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities and then used to find meaningful anomalies

within the field of data analytics machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction in commercial use this is known as predictive analytics these analytical models allow researchers data scientists engineers and analysts to produce reliable repeatable decisions and results and uncover hidden insights through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data

overview

tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally operational rather than cognitive terms thus following alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence that the question can machines think be replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do in the proposal he explores the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one
types of problems and tasks

machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback available to a learning system these are

    supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
    unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning
    reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent the program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space

between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target outputs missing transduction is a special case of this principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time except that part of the targets are missing

among other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates its own sequences also called curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous selfexploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning maturation motor synergies and imitation

another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machinelearned system

    in classification inputs are divided into two or more classes and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more multilabel classification of these classes this is typically tackled in a supervised way spam filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other messages and the classes are spam and not spam
    in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous rather than discrete
    in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided into groups unlike in classification the groups are not known beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
    density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
    dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lowerdimensional space topic modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics

history and relationships to other fields

as a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence already in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis

however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation by  expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favor work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval  neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the aics field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

machine learning reorganized as a separate field started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data

machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set examples the difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples
relation to statistics

machine learning and statistics are closely related fields according to michael i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field

leo breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest

some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning
theory

a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases

the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error

for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer

in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time
approaches

deep learning

falling hardware prices and the development of gpus for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition
inductive logic programming

inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs

support vector machines svms are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other
clustering

cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness similarity between members of the same cluster and separation between different clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and a common technique for statistical data analysis
bayesian networks

a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning
reinforcement learning

reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of longterm reward reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct inputoutput pairs are never presented nor suboptimal actions explicitly corrected
representation learning

several learning algorithms mostly unsupervised learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions allowing to reconstruct the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution

manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into highdimensional vectors deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data
similarity and metric learning

in this problem the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects it then needs to learn a similarity function or a distance metric function that can predict if new objects are similar it is sometimes used in recommendation systems
sparse dictionary learning

in this method a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse let x be a ddimensional datum d be a d by n matrix where each column of d represents a basis function r is the coefficient to represent x using d mathematically sparse dictionary learning means solving x ≈ d r displaystyle xapprox dr displaystyle xapprox dr where r is sparse generally speaking n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation

learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly nphard and also difficult to solve approximately a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is ksvd

sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built then a new datum is associated with the class such that its best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot

machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data  such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data driven predictions or decisions through building a model from sample inputs machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible example applications include spam filtering detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach optical character recognition ocr search engines and computer vision

machine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics which also focuses in predictionmaking through the use of computers it has strong ties to mathematical optimization which delivers methods theory and application domains to the field machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learningvii machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities and then used to find meaningful anomalies

within the field of data analytics machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction in commercial use this is known as predictive analytics these analytical models allow researchers data scientists engineers and analysts to produce reliable repeatable decisions and results and uncover hidden insights through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data

overview

tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally operational rather than cognitive terms thus following alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence that the question can machines think be replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do in the proposal he explores the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one
types of problems and tasks

machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback available to a learning system these are

    supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
    unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning
    reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent the program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space

between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target outputs missing transduction is a special case of this principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time except that part of the targets are missing

among other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates its own sequences also called curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous selfexploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning maturation motor synergies and imitation

another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machinelearned system

    in classification inputs are divided into two or more classes and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more multilabel classification of these classes this is typically tackled in a supervised way spam filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other messages and the classes are spam and not spam
    in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous rather than discrete
    in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided into groups unlike in classification the groups are not known beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
    density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
    dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lowerdimensional space topic modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics

history and relationships to other fields

as a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence already in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis

however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation by  expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favor work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval  neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the aics field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

machine learning reorganized as a separate field started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data

machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set examples the difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples
relation to statistics

machine learning and statistics are closely related fields according to michael i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field

leo breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest

some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning
theory

a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases

the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error

for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer

in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time
approaches

deep learning

falling hardware prices and the development of gpus for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition
inductive logic programming

inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs

support vector machines svms are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other
clustering

cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness similarity between members of the same cluster and separation between different clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and a common technique for statistical data analysis
bayesian networks

a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning
reinforcement learning

reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of longterm reward reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct inputoutput pairs are never presented nor suboptimal actions explicitly corrected
representation learning

several learning algorithms mostly unsupervised learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions allowing to reconstruct the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution

manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into highdimensional vectors deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data
similarity and metric learning

in this problem the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects it then needs to learn a similarity function or a distance metric function that can predict if new objects are similar it is sometimes used in recommendation systems
sparse dictionary learning

in this method a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse let x be a ddimensional datum d be a d by n matrix where each column of d represents a basis function r is the coefficient to represent x using d mathematically sparse dictionary learning means solving x ≈ d r displaystyle xapprox dr displaystyle xapprox dr where r is sparse generally speaking n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation

learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly nphard and also difficult to solve approximately a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is ksvd

sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built then a new datum is associated with the class such that its best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot

machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data  such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data driven predictions or decisions through building a model from sample inputs machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible example applications include spam filtering detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach optical character recognition ocr search engines and computer vision

machine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics which also focuses in predictionmaking through the use of computers it has strong ties to mathematical optimization which delivers methods theory and application domains to the field machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learningvii machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities and then used to find meaningful anomalies

within the field of data analytics machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction in commercial use this is known as predictive analytics these analytical models allow researchers data scientists engineers and analysts to produce reliable repeatable decisions and results and uncover hidden insights through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data

overview

tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally operational rather than cognitive terms thus following alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence that the question can machines think be replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do in the proposal he explores the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one
types of problems and tasks

machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback available to a learning system these are

    supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
    unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning
    reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent the program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space

between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target outputs missing transduction is a special case of this principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time except that part of the targets are missing

among other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates its own sequences also called curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous selfexploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning maturation motor synergies and imitation

another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machinelearned system

    in classification inputs are divided into two or more classes and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more multilabel classification of these classes this is typically tackled in a supervised way spam filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other messages and the classes are spam and not spam
    in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous rather than discrete
    in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided into groups unlike in classification the groups are not known beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
    density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
    dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lowerdimensional space topic modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics

history and relationships to other fields

as a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence already in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis

however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation by  expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favor work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval  neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the aics field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

machine learning reorganized as a separate field started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data

machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set examples the difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples
relation to statistics

machine learning and statistics are closely related fields according to michael i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field

leo breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest

some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning
theory

a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases

the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error

for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer

in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time
approaches

deep learning

falling hardware prices and the development of gpus for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition
inductive logic programming

inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs

support vector machines svms are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other
clustering

cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness similarity between members of the same cluster and separation between different clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and a common technique for statistical data analysis
bayesian networks

a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning
reinforcement learning

reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of longterm reward reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct inputoutput pairs are never presented nor suboptimal actions explicitly corrected
representation learning

several learning algorithms mostly unsupervised learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions allowing to reconstruct the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution

manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into highdimensional vectors deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data
similarity and metric learning

in this problem the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects it then needs to learn a similarity function or a distance metric function that can predict if new objects are similar it is sometimes used in recommendation systems
sparse dictionary learning

in this method a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse let x be a ddimensional datum d be a d by n matrix where each column of d represents a basis function r is the coefficient to represent x using d mathematically sparse dictionary learning means solving x ≈ d r displaystyle xapprox dr displaystyle xapprox dr where r is sparse generally speaking n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation

learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly nphard and also difficult to solve approximately a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is ksvd

sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built then a new datum is associated with the class such that its best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot

machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data  such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data driven predictions or decisions through building a model from sample inputs machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible example applications include spam filtering detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach optical character recognition ocr search engines and computer vision

machine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics which also focuses in predictionmaking through the use of computers it has strong ties to mathematical optimization which delivers methods theory and application domains to the field machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learningvii machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities and then used to find meaningful anomalies

within the field of data analytics machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction in commercial use this is known as predictive analytics these analytical models allow researchers data scientists engineers and analysts to produce reliable repeatable decisions and results and uncover hidden insights through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data

overview

tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally operational rather than cognitive terms thus following alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence that the question can machines think be replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do in the proposal he explores the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one
types of problems and tasks

machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback available to a learning system these are

    supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
    unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning
    reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent the program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space

between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target outputs missing transduction is a special case of this principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time except that part of the targets are missing

among other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates its own sequences also called curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous selfexploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning maturation motor synergies and imitation

another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machinelearned system

    in classification inputs are divided into two or more classes and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more multilabel classification of these classes this is typically tackled in a supervised way spam filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other messages and the classes are spam and not spam
    in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous rather than discrete
    in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided into groups unlike in classification the groups are not known beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
    density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
    dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lowerdimensional space topic modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics

history and relationships to other fields

as a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence already in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis

however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation by  expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favor work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval  neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the aics field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

machine learning reorganized as a separate field started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data

machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set examples the difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples
relation to statistics

machine learning and statistics are closely related fields according to michael i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field

leo breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest

some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning
theory

a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases

the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error

for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer

in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time
approaches

support vector machines svms are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other
clustering

cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness similarity between members of the same cluster and separation between different clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and a common technique for statistical data analysis
bayesian networks

a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning
reinforcement learning

reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of longterm reward reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct inputoutput pairs are never presented nor suboptimal actions explicitly corrected
representation learning

several learning algorithms mostly unsupervised learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions allowing to reconstruct the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution

manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into highdimensional vectors deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data
similarity and metric learning

in this problem the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects it then needs to learn a similarity function or a distance metric function that can predict if new objects are similar it is sometimes used in recommendation systems
sparse dictionary learning

in this method a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse let x be a ddimensional datum d be a d by n matrix where each column of d represents a basis function r is the coefficient to represent x using d mathematically sparse dictionary learning means solving x ≈ d r displaystyle xapprox dr displaystyle xapprox dr where r is sparse generally speaking n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation

learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly nphard and also difficult to solve approximately a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is ksvd

sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built then a new datum is associated with the class such that its best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot
