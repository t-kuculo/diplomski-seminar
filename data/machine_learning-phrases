 overview

 tom_m mitchell_provided a widely_quoted more_formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience_e with_respect to some class of tasks_t and performance_measure p_if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p_improves with experience_e this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally_operational rather_than cognitive_terms thus_following alan_turings proposal in his_paper computing_machinery and intelligence that the question_can machines_think be replaced with the question_can machines do_what we as thinking_entities can do in the proposal_he explores the various_characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various_implications in constructing_one
 types of problems and tasks

 machine learning tasks are typically_classified into_three broad_categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback_available to a learning system these are

 supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired_outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
 unsupervised learning no_labels are given to the learning algorithm_leaving it on its_own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself_discovering hidden_patterns in data or a means_towards an end_feature learning
 reinforcement learning a computer program_interacts with a dynamic_environment in which it must_perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game_against an opponent the program is provided_feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates_its problem space

 between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher_gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target_outputs missing_transduction is a special_case of this_principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time_except that part of the targets are missing

 among_other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its_own inductive_bias based_on previous_experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates_its own_sequences also called_curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively_acquire repertoires of novel_skills through_autonomous selfexploration and social_interaction with human_teachers and using_guidance mechanisms_such as active learning maturation_motor synergies and imitation

 another_categorization of machine learning tasks_arises when_one considers the desired_output of a machinelearned_system

 in classification inputs are divided_into two or more classes and the learner_must produce a model that assigns_unseen inputs to one or more_multilabel classification of these classes this is typically_tackled in a supervised way spam_filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other_messages and the classes are spam and not spam
 in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous_rather than_discrete
 in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided_into groups_unlike in classification the groups are not known_beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
 density_estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
 dimensionality_reduction simplifies_inputs by mapping_them into a lowerdimensional_space topic_modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language_documents and is tasked to find out which documents_cover similar_topics

 history and relationships to other fields

 as a scientific_endeavour machine learning grew_out of the quest for artificial_intelligence already in the early_days of ai as an academic_discipline some researchers were_interested in having_machines learn from data they_attempted to approach the problem with various_symbolic methods as well as what_were then_termed neural_networks these were_mostly perceptrons and other models that were_later found to be reinventions of the generalized_linear models of statistics probabilistic_reasoning was also employed_especially in automated_medical diagnosis

 however an increasing_emphasis on the logical_knowledgebased approach_caused a rift_between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were_plagued by theoretical and practical_problems of data acquisition and representation by expert_systems had_come to dominate_ai and statistics was out of favor_work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did_continue within ai leading to inductive_logic programming but the more statistical_line of research was_now outside the field of ai_proper in pattern_recognition and information_retrieval neural_networks research_had been_abandoned by ai and computer_science around the same time this line_too was_continued outside the aics_field as connectionism by researchers from other_disciplines including_hopfield rumelhart and hinton_their main_success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

 machine learning reorganized as a separate field_started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving_artificial intelligence to tackling_solvable problems of a practical_nature it shifted_focus away from the symbolic_approaches it had_inherited from ai and toward_methods and models_borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also_benefited from the increasing_availability of digitized_information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

 machine learning and data mining often_employ the same methods and overlap_significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction_based on known properties_learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously_unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different_goals on the other_hand machine learning also_employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing_step to improve learner accuracy_much of the confusion_between these two research_communities which do often have separate_conferences and separate_journals ecml_pkdd being a major_exception comes from the basic_assumptions they_work with in machine learning performance is usually_evaluated with_respect to the ability to reproduce_known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key_task is the discovery of previously_unknown knowledge evaluated with_respect to known knowledge an uninformed_unsupervised method will_easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical_kdd task supervised methods cannot be used_due to the unavailability of training data

 machine learning also has_intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss_functions express the discrepancy_between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual_problem instances for example in classification one_wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly_predict the preassigned_labels of a set examples the difference_between the two fields_arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen_samples
 relation to statistics

 machine learning and statistics are closely_related fields_according to michael_i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological_principles to theoretical_tools have had a long_prehistory in statistics he also_suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall_field

 the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer_science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually_does not_yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead_probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite_common the biasvariance_decomposition is one way to quantify_generalization error

 for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis_should match the complexity of the function_underlying the data if the hypothesis is less_complex than the function then the model has_underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response_then the training error_decreases but if the hypothesis is too_complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer

 in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists_study the time_complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered_feasible if it can be done in polynomial_time there are two_kinds of time_complexity results positive results_show that a certain_class of functions can be learned in polynomial_time negative results_show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial_time

 machine learning
 from wikipedia the free_encyclopedia

 machine learning is the subfield of computer_science that gives_computers the ability to learn without_being explicitly_programmed evolved from the study of pattern_recognition and computational learning theory in artificial_intelligence machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make_predictions on data such algorithms overcome_following strictly_static program_instructions by making data driven_predictions or decisions_through building a model from sample_inputs machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where_designing and programming_explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible_example applications include spam_filtering detection of network_intruders or malicious_insiders working_towards a data breach_optical character_recognition ocr_search engines and computer_vision

 machine learning is closely_related to and often_overlaps with computational statistics which also focuses in predictionmaking_through the use of computers it has_strong ties to mathematical_optimization which_delivers methods theory and application_domains to the field machine learning is sometimes_conflated with data mining where the latter_subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised_learningvii machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish_baseline behavioral_profiles for various_entities and then used to find_meaningful anomalies

 overview

 tom_m mitchell_provided a widely_quoted more_formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience_e with_respect to some class of tasks_t and performance_measure p_if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p_improves with experience_e this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally_operational rather_than cognitive_terms thus_following alan_turings proposal in his_paper computing_machinery and intelligence that the question_can machines_think be replaced with the question_can machines do_what we as thinking_entities can do in the proposal_he explores the various_characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various_implications in constructing_one
 types of problems and tasks

 machine learning tasks are typically_classified into_three broad_categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback_available to a learning system these are

 supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired_outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
 unsupervised learning no_labels are given to the learning algorithm_leaving it on its_own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself_discovering hidden_patterns in data or a means_towards an end_feature learning
 reinforcement learning a computer program_interacts with a dynamic_environment in which it must_perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game_against an opponent the program is provided_feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates_its problem space

 between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher_gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target_outputs missing_transduction is a special_case of this_principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time_except that part of the targets are missing

 among_other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its_own inductive_bias based_on previous_experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates_its own_sequences also called_curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively_acquire repertoires of novel_skills through_autonomous selfexploration and social_interaction with human_teachers and using_guidance mechanisms_such as active learning maturation_motor synergies and imitation

 another_categorization of machine learning tasks_arises when_one considers the desired_output of a machinelearned_system

 in classification inputs are divided_into two or more classes and the learner_must produce a model that assigns_unseen inputs to one or more_multilabel classification of these classes this is typically_tackled in a supervised way spam_filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other_messages and the classes are spam and not spam
 in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous_rather than_discrete
 in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided_into groups_unlike in classification the groups are not known_beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
 density_estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
 dimensionality_reduction simplifies_inputs by mapping_them into a lowerdimensional_space topic_modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language_documents and is tasked to find out which documents_cover similar_topics

 history and relationships to other fields

 as a scientific_endeavour machine learning grew_out of the quest for artificial_intelligence already in the early_days of ai as an academic_discipline some researchers were_interested in having_machines learn from data they_attempted to approach the problem with various_symbolic methods as well as what_were then_termed neural_networks these were_mostly perceptrons and other models that were_later found to be reinventions of the generalized_linear models of statistics probabilistic_reasoning was also employed_especially in automated_medical diagnosis

 however an increasing_emphasis on the logical_knowledgebased approach_caused a rift_between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were_plagued by theoretical and practical_problems of data acquisition and representation by expert_systems had_come to dominate_ai and statistics was out of favor_work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did_continue within ai leading to inductive_logic programming but the more statistical_line of research was_now outside the field of ai_proper in pattern_recognition and information_retrieval neural_networks research_had been_abandoned by ai and computer_science around the same time this line_too was_continued outside the aics_field as connectionism by researchers from other_disciplines including_hopfield rumelhart and hinton_their main_success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

 machine learning reorganized as a separate field_started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving_artificial intelligence to tackling_solvable problems of a practical_nature it shifted_focus away from the symbolic_approaches it had_inherited from ai and toward_methods and models_borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also_benefited from the increasing_availability of digitized_information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

 machine learning and data mining often_employ the same methods and overlap_significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction_based on known properties_learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously_unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different_goals on the other_hand machine learning also_employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing_step to improve learner accuracy_much of the confusion_between these two research_communities which do often have separate_conferences and separate_journals ecml_pkdd being a major_exception comes from the basic_assumptions they_work with in machine learning performance is usually_evaluated with_respect to the ability to reproduce_known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key_task is the discovery of previously_unknown knowledge evaluated with_respect to known knowledge an uninformed_unsupervised method will_easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical_kdd task supervised methods cannot be used_due to the unavailability of training data

 machine learning also has_intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss_functions express the discrepancy_between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual_problem instances for example in classification one_wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly_predict the preassigned_labels of a set examples the difference_between the two fields_arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen_samples

 the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer_science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually_does not_yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead_probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite_common the biasvariance_decomposition is one way to quantify_generalization error

 for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis_should match the complexity of the function_underlying the data if the hypothesis is less_complex than the function then the model has_underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response_then the training error_decreases but if the hypothesis is too_complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer

 in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists_study the time_complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered_feasible if it can be done in polynomial_time there are two_kinds of time_complexity results positive results_show that a certain_class of functions can be learned in polynomial_time negative results_show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial_time

 overview

 tom_m mitchell_provided a widely_quoted more_formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience_e with_respect to some class of tasks_t and performance_measure p_if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p_improves with experience_e this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally_operational rather_than cognitive_terms thus_following alan_turings proposal in his_paper computing_machinery and intelligence that the question_can machines_think be replaced with the question_can machines do_what we as thinking_entities can do in the proposal_he explores the various_characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various_implications in constructing_one
 types of problems and tasks

 machine learning tasks are typically_classified into_three broad_categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback_available to a learning system these are

 supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired_outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
 unsupervised learning no_labels are given to the learning algorithm_leaving it on its_own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself_discovering hidden_patterns in data or a means_towards an end_feature learning
 reinforcement learning a computer program_interacts with a dynamic_environment in which it must_perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game_against an opponent the program is provided_feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates_its problem space

 between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher_gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target_outputs missing_transduction is a special_case of this_principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time_except that part of the targets are missing

 among_other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its_own inductive_bias based_on previous_experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates_its own_sequences also called_curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively_acquire repertoires of novel_skills through_autonomous selfexploration and social_interaction with human_teachers and using_guidance mechanisms_such as active learning maturation_motor synergies and imitation

 another_categorization of machine learning tasks_arises when_one considers the desired_output of a machinelearned_system

 in classification inputs are divided_into two or more classes and the learner_must produce a model that assigns_unseen inputs to one or more_multilabel classification of these classes this is typically_tackled in a supervised way spam_filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other_messages and the classes are spam and not spam
 in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous_rather than_discrete
 in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided_into groups_unlike in classification the groups are not known_beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
 density_estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
 dimensionality_reduction simplifies_inputs by mapping_them into a lowerdimensional_space topic_modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language_documents and is tasked to find out which documents_cover similar_topics

 history and relationships to other fields

 as a scientific_endeavour machine learning grew_out of the quest for artificial_intelligence already in the early_days of ai as an academic_discipline some researchers were_interested in having_machines learn from data they_attempted to approach the problem with various_symbolic methods as well as what_were then_termed neural_networks these were_mostly perceptrons and other models that were_later found to be reinventions of the generalized_linear models of statistics probabilistic_reasoning was also employed_especially in automated_medical diagnosis

 however an increasing_emphasis on the logical_knowledgebased approach_caused a rift_between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were_plagued by theoretical and practical_problems of data acquisition and representation by expert_systems had_come to dominate_ai and statistics was out of favor_work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did_continue within ai leading to inductive_logic programming but the more statistical_line of research was_now outside the field of ai_proper in pattern_recognition and information_retrieval neural_networks research_had been_abandoned by ai and computer_science around the same time this line_too was_continued outside the aics_field as connectionism by researchers from other_disciplines including_hopfield rumelhart and hinton_their main_success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

 machine learning reorganized as a separate field_started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving_artificial intelligence to tackling_solvable problems of a practical_nature it shifted_focus away from the symbolic_approaches it had_inherited from ai and toward_methods and models_borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also_benefited from the increasing_availability of digitized_information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

 machine learning and data mining often_employ the same methods and overlap_significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction_based on known properties_learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously_unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different_goals on the other_hand machine learning also_employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing_step to improve learner accuracy_much of the confusion_between these two research_communities which do often have separate_conferences and separate_journals ecml_pkdd being a major_exception comes from the basic_assumptions they_work with in machine learning performance is usually_evaluated with_respect to the ability to reproduce_known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key_task is the discovery of previously_unknown knowledge evaluated with_respect to known knowledge an uninformed_unsupervised method will_easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical_kdd task supervised methods cannot be used_due to the unavailability of training data

 machine learning also has_intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss_functions express the discrepancy_between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual_problem instances for example in classification one_wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly_predict the preassigned_labels of a set examples the difference_between the two fields_arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen_samples
 relation to statistics

 machine learning and statistics are closely_related fields_according to michael_i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological_principles to theoretical_tools have had a long_prehistory in statistics he also_suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall_field

 leo_breiman distinguished_two statistical_modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein_algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like_random forest

 some_statisticians have_adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined_field that they_call statistical learning
 theory

 a core_objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform_accurately on new unseen_examplestasks after_having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally_unknown probability_distribution considered_representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce_sufficiently accurate_predictions in new_cases

 the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer_science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually_does not_yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead_probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite_common the biasvariance_decomposition is one way to quantify_generalization error

 in classification inputs are divided_into two or more classes and the learner_must produce a model that assigns_unseen inputs to one or more_multilabel classification of these classes this is typically_tackled in a supervised way spam_filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other_messages and the classes are spam and not spam
 in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous_rather than_discrete
 in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided_into groups_unlike in classification the groups are not known_beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
 density_estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
 dimensionality_reduction simplifies_inputs by mapping_them into a lowerdimensional_space topic_modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language_documents and is tasked to find out which documents_cover similar_topics

 history and relationships to other fields

 as a scientific_endeavour machine learning grew_out of the quest for artificial_intelligence already in the early_days of ai as an academic_discipline some researchers were_interested in having_machines learn from data they_attempted to approach the problem with various_symbolic methods as well as what_were then_termed neural_networks these were_mostly perceptrons and other models that were_later found to be reinventions of the generalized_linear models of statistics probabilistic_reasoning was also employed_especially in automated_medical diagnosis

 however an increasing_emphasis on the logical_knowledgebased approach_caused a rift_between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were_plagued by theoretical and practical_problems of data acquisition and representation by expert_systems had_come to dominate_ai and statistics was out of favor_work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did_continue within ai leading to inductive_logic programming but the more statistical_line of research was_now outside the field of ai_proper in pattern_recognition and information_retrieval neural_networks research_had been_abandoned by ai and computer_science around the same time this line_too was_continued outside the aics_field as connectionism by researchers from other_disciplines including_hopfield rumelhart and hinton_their main_success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

 machine learning reorganized as a separate field_started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving_artificial intelligence to tackling_solvable problems of a practical_nature it shifted_focus away from the symbolic_approaches it had_inherited from ai and toward_methods and models_borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also_benefited from the increasing_availability of digitized_information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

 machine learning and data mining often_employ the same methods and overlap_significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction_based on known properties_learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously_unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different_goals on the other_hand machine learning also_employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing_step to improve learner accuracy_much of the confusion_between these two research_communities which do often have separate_conferences and separate_journals ecml_pkdd being a major_exception comes from the basic_assumptions they_work with in machine learning performance is usually_evaluated with_respect to the ability to reproduce_known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key_task is the discovery of previously_unknown knowledge evaluated with_respect to known knowledge an uninformed_unsupervised method will_easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical_kdd task supervised methods cannot be used_due to the unavailability of training data

 machine learning also has_intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss_functions express the discrepancy_between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual_problem instances for example in classification one_wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly_predict the preassigned_labels of a set examples the difference_between the two fields_arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen_samples
 relation to statistics

 the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer_science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually_does not_yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead_probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite_common the biasvariance_decomposition is one way to quantify_generalization error

 for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis_should match the complexity of the function_underlying the data if the hypothesis is less_complex than the function then the model has_underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response_then the training error_decreases but if the hypothesis is too_complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer

 in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists_study the time_complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered_feasible if it can be done in polynomial_time there are two_kinds of time_complexity results positive results_show that a certain_class of functions can be learned in polynomial_time negative results_show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial_time

 types of problems and tasks

 machine learning tasks are typically_classified into_three broad_categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback_available to a learning system these are

 supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired_outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
 unsupervised learning no_labels are given to the learning algorithm_leaving it on its_own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself_discovering hidden_patterns in data or a means_towards an end_feature learning
 reinforcement learning a computer program_interacts with a dynamic_environment in which it must_perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game_against an opponent the program is provided_feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates_its problem space

 between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher_gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target_outputs missing_transduction is a special_case of this_principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time_except that part of the targets are missing

 among_other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its_own inductive_bias based_on previous_experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates_its own_sequences also called_curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively_acquire repertoires of novel_skills through_autonomous selfexploration and social_interaction with human_teachers and using_guidance mechanisms_such as active learning maturation_motor synergies and imitation

 machine learning
 from wikipedia the free_encyclopedia

 machine learning is the subfield of computer_science that gives_computers the ability to learn without_being explicitly_programmed evolved from the study of pattern_recognition and computational learning theory in artificial_intelligence machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make_predictions on data such algorithms overcome_following strictly_static program_instructions by making data driven_predictions or decisions_through building a model from sample_inputs machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where_designing and programming_explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible_example applications include spam_filtering detection of network_intruders or malicious_insiders working_towards a data breach_optical character_recognition ocr_search engines and computer_vision

 machine learning is closely_related to and often_overlaps with computational statistics which also focuses in predictionmaking_through the use of computers it has_strong ties to mathematical_optimization which_delivers methods theory and application_domains to the field machine learning is sometimes_conflated with data mining where the latter_subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised_learningvii machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish_baseline behavioral_profiles for various_entities and then used to find_meaningful anomalies

 within the field of data analytics machine learning is a method used to devise_complex models and algorithms that lend_themselves to prediction in commercial_use this is known as predictive_analytics these_analytical models allow_researchers data scientists_engineers and analysts to produce_reliable repeatable_decisions and results and uncover_hidden insights_through learning from historical_relationships and trends in the data

 overview

 tom_m mitchell_provided a widely_quoted more_formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience_e with_respect to some class of tasks_t and performance_measure p_if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p_improves with experience_e this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally_operational rather_than cognitive_terms thus_following alan_turings proposal in his_paper computing_machinery and intelligence that the question_can machines_think be replaced with the question_can machines do_what we as thinking_entities can do in the proposal_he explores the various_characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various_implications in constructing_one
 types of problems and tasks

 machine learning tasks are typically_classified into_three broad_categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback_available to a learning system these are

 supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired_outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
 unsupervised learning no_labels are given to the learning algorithm_leaving it on its_own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself_discovering hidden_patterns in data or a means_towards an end_feature learning
 reinforcement learning a computer program_interacts with a dynamic_environment in which it must_perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game_against an opponent the program is provided_feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates_its problem space

 between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher_gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target_outputs missing_transduction is a special_case of this_principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time_except that part of the targets are missing

 among_other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its_own inductive_bias based_on previous_experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates_its own_sequences also called_curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively_acquire repertoires of novel_skills through_autonomous selfexploration and social_interaction with human_teachers and using_guidance mechanisms_such as active learning maturation_motor synergies and imitation

 another_categorization of machine learning tasks_arises when_one considers the desired_output of a machinelearned_system

 in classification inputs are divided_into two or more classes and the learner_must produce a model that assigns_unseen inputs to one or more_multilabel classification of these classes this is typically_tackled in a supervised way spam_filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other_messages and the classes are spam and not spam
 in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous_rather than_discrete
 in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided_into groups_unlike in classification the groups are not known_beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task
 density_estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space
 dimensionality_reduction simplifies_inputs by mapping_them into a lowerdimensional_space topic_modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language_documents and is tasked to find out which documents_cover similar_topics

 history and relationships to other fields

 as a scientific_endeavour machine learning grew_out of the quest for artificial_intelligence already in the early_days of ai as an academic_discipline some researchers were_interested in having_machines learn from data they_attempted to approach the problem with various_symbolic methods as well as what_were then_termed neural_networks these were_mostly perceptrons and other models that were_later found to be reinventions of the generalized_linear models of statistics probabilistic_reasoning was also employed_especially in automated_medical diagnosis

 however an increasing_emphasis on the logical_knowledgebased approach_caused a rift_between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were_plagued by theoretical and practical_problems of data acquisition and representation by expert_systems had_come to dominate_ai and statistics was out of favor_work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did_continue within ai leading to inductive_logic programming but the more statistical_line of research was_now outside the field of ai_proper in pattern_recognition and information_retrieval neural_networks research_had been_abandoned by ai and computer_science around the same time this line_too was_continued outside the aics_field as connectionism by researchers from other_disciplines including_hopfield rumelhart and hinton_their main_success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation

 machine learning reorganized as a separate field_started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving_artificial intelligence to tackling_solvable problems of a practical_nature it shifted_focus away from the symbolic_approaches it had_inherited from ai and toward_methods and models_borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also_benefited from the increasing_availability of digitized_information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet

 machine learning and data mining often_employ the same methods and overlap_significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction_based on known properties_learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously_unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different_goals on the other_hand machine learning also_employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing_step to improve learner accuracy_much of the confusion_between these two research_communities which do often have separate_conferences and separate_journals ecml_pkdd being a major_exception comes from the basic_assumptions they_work with in machine learning performance is usually_evaluated with_respect to the ability to reproduce_known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key_task is the discovery of previously_unknown knowledge evaluated with_respect to known knowledge an uninformed_unsupervised method will_easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical_kdd task supervised methods cannot be used_due to the unavailability of training data

 machine learning also has_intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss_functions express the discrepancy_between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual_problem instances for example in classification one_wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly_predict the preassigned_labels of a set examples the difference_between the two fields_arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen_samples
 relation to statistics

 machine learning and statistics are closely_related fields_according to michael_i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological_principles to theoretical_tools have had a long_prehistory in statistics he also_suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall_field

 leo_breiman distinguished_two statistical_modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein_algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like_random forest

 some_statisticians have_adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined_field that they_call statistical learning
 theory

 a core_objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform_accurately on new unseen_examplestasks after_having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally_unknown probability_distribution considered_representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce_sufficiently accurate_predictions in new_cases

 the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer_science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually_does not_yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead_probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite_common the biasvariance_decomposition is one way to quantify_generalization error

 for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis_should match the complexity of the function_underlying the data if the hypothesis is less_complex than the function then the model has_underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response_then the training error_decreases but if the hypothesis is too_complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer

 in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists_study the time_complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered_feasible if it can be done in polynomial_time there are two_kinds of time_complexity results positive results_show that a certain_class of functions can be learned in polynomial_time negative results_show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial_time
